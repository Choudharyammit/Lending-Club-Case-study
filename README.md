## General Information
- This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis    (EDA) on a loan dataset to understand the factors influencing loan default.
- The business problem being addressed is how to identify risky loan applicants in order to minimize credit loss for a lending company.
- The dataset used contains information about past loan applicants, including loan status, borrower attributes, and loan attributes.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Loans with longer terms and higher interest rates are associated with higher default rates.
- Small business loans, renewable energy loans, and educational loans are among the riskiest loan categories.
- Applicants with medium annual income tend to default more often, especially when applying for higher loan amounts.
